## About

I like tinkering with computers, spending time with my family and watch sports, mainly football.

## Currently

I’m working for Aditro as a DevOps Engineer.

My main responsibilities has been implementing and maintaining our monitoring solution, it is a Prometheus based solution with all that comes with it! So we leverage a whole bunch of exporters (both from the community and written by us), Grafana, Alert Manager and our own alert dashboard.

Other then monitoring my days can consist of a variety of tasks or projects such as creating a release pipeline in Azure DevOps, writing shell scripts, helping our HR Consultants with customer support, creating a self-service portal for creating new customer tenants and much more. It’s really a job where no day is the same.

Here are some technolgies that I've gotten to work with at Aditro,

- Prometheus
- Grafana
- Elastic
- Docker Swarm
- Azure DevOps Pipelines
- Shell scripting, mostly Bash and Powershell
- Linux, mostly Rancher
- Nutanix
- SQL, mainly MSSQL but I've also used Postgres and MySQL
- Python
- JavaScript
- ASP.NET Core
